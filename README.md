# jVSTwRapper

Archive of original code from http://jvstwrapper.sourceforge.net/

This is an archive of that original library (which 
has not been updated since 2011)

The original library was hosted on SourceForge using CVS (tools 
more popular in the days of yore)

By hosting it here using git, it may hopefully see new life.

## Changes made

Very few changes have been made to the repository, namely:

* Converting repository from multi-module CVS repository into single git repository (using git-cvsimport)

* Creating .gitignore files as copies of the original .cvsignore files

* Adding repository attributes such as LICENSE and README.md

## Thanks

Many thanks to the original author of the library Daniel Reinert
